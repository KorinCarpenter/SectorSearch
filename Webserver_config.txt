Create AWS EC2 Instance running Amazon Linux with port 22 open to admin IP addresses, and ports 80 and 443 open to all traffic.
Need low storage, low compute power, medium ram, high throughput.
Install Apache and configure webserver, and place the Website.html file from the FrontEnd folder of the GitHub repository into the /var/html folder.
Start the Apache service (“service httpd start” if I remember correctly) and connect to the IP or designated endpoint of the webserver, and you should be good to go.
